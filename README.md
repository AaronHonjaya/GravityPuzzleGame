# GravityPuzzleGame
This is my first time creating a game or dealing with Java Graphics, so apologies for any rookie mistakes or organizational issues. I'm always looking for ways to improve, so if you have any advice, please let me know by email!

The game consists of two players that have different gravitational directions (e.g. one falls down and jumps up. The other may fall right and jump left). 
The goal is for both players to reach their respective flags. To do so, they must use their unique gravities to help each other navigate the terrain. 

This game is something I only started developing in late August, and I'm planning to continue adding to this game in my free time. 

Here's a list of everything I have completed so far: 
- Character movement and collision logic for 2 gravity directions (gravity pulling down and pulling right). 
- Level creator/loader that will load a level from a given image.
- Level Completion Logic - knows when both players have reached their flags and will autoload the next level. 
- Menu Screen and a level selector
- Tutorial for new players.

Here's some stuff I am planning to add in the future (this list can and will grow! if you have any suggestions, please reach out to me through my email above)
- More Levels! (I only have two for testing right now haha). 
- Character movement and collision logic for the remaining two gravity directions (gravity pulling up and pulling left)
- Ability/item to reverse gravity (e.g. character w/ down gravity can use an item so that gravity pulls up).
- Blocks that can be pushed (maybe used to allow characters to reach places they couldn't before).

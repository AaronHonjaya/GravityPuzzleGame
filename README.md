# GravityPuzzleGame
This is a game I developed myself with the help of a couple Java Graphics tutorial videos. 

The game consists of two players that have different gravitational directions (e.g. one falls down and jumps up. The other may fall right and jump left). 
The goal is for both players to reach their respective flags. To do so, they must use their unique gravities to help each other navigate the terrain.
